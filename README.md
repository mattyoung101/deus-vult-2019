Deus Vult ESP32 IDF
====================

This repository contains the code powering Team Deus Vult's 2019 robot, competing in RoboCup Jr Soccer. It is written almost entirely in C, without some Python scripts for code generation and debugging.

For more information on our robot, please see our team's PowerPoint and poster.

Contact Matt Young (25070@bbc.qld.edu.au) for any questions, queries, qualms or concerns.

**License:** This code is currently proprietary and confidential to Brisbane Boys' College and Team Deus Vult. No redistribution or use outside BBC teams is permitted.

**Contributing:** No contributions will be accepted, sorry.

**Issues:** We manage all issues on Trello, so the GitHub bug tracker isn't used.
